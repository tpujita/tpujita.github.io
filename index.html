								<h2>Introduction<br />
								</h2>
								<p>I am a sophomore at Saint Francis High School in Mountain View, California.<br />
								Ever since I was little, I have always had a love of science. I want to study astrophysics in college.<br />
								This field is fascinating to me because scientists know so little about the vast universe, and I never want to stop learning about it.<br />
								I also love making music, listening to music, and performing with my peers.<br />
								My other interests include photography and photo editing.</p>

								<h3>Got Antioxidants? Using Chemiluminescence to Study the Effect of
									Adding Milk or Sugar on the Antioxidant Level of Tea</h3>
								<p>This project, which I completed in 6th grade, is about how milk and sugar affect the <b> antioxidant levels</b> of green and black tea. I
										used three different increments of each type of additive: 10, 20, and 30 mL of milk; and 1⁄4, 1⁄2,
										and 1 tsp of sugar. I tested the amount of antioxidants using a <b>chemiluminescence reaction </b> and a
										<b>light-detecting circuit</b>. Because antioxidants inhibit this reaction, I was able to see relative antioxidant
										levels based off of light levels. To get a quantitative measure of the light intensity, I made a light-detecting 
										circuit, which measured light intensity in voltage. Using this data, I found that adding
										more milk or sugar to both green and black tea leads to more light intensity, which represents
										lower antioxidant levels.</p>

								<h3>A Green, Low-Cost Adsorbent for the Removal of Dye from Aqueous Solutions</h3>
								<p>The purpose of this project, which I conducted in 7th grade, was to test the efficiency of spent tea leaves (STL) as a low cost
										adsorbent of dye using a column adsorption filter system. In this experiment, the effect of flow rate,
										adsorbent dose, and initial dye concentration on the adsorption of methylene blue by STL was studied.
										The variables were tested by a column adsorption filter system, and
										samples were analyzed using a homemade spectrophotometer. Maximum dye removal efficiency of up to
										99% was attained depending on the adsorption conditions. Maximum adsorption capacity of 95.41 mg/g
										was also obtained. In conclusion, a column filter system using STL can be
										applied in the real world for the removal of dyes from industrial wastewaters as a green, cost-effective
										alternative to other expensive treatment methods.</p>

								<h3>A Green, Low-Cost Solution for the Removal and Recovery of Dye from Industrial Wastewater (A Second Year Study)</h3>
								<p>The purpose of this project (a continuation of my 7th project that I conducted in 8th grade) was to study the efficiency of spent tea leaves (STL) as a green, low-cost solution for the removal 
									and recovery of dye from wastewater. The effect of temperature on adsorption, and pH on adsorption and desorption of dye by STL was studied to find the maximum adsorption capacity and percent desorbed by performing continuous 
									studies. Maximum adsorption capacity increased by 139% from a single cycle to continuous studies. Desorption studies led to 94.44% recovery of dye. Therefore, this column 
									adsorption system using STL has the potential to be scaled to an industrial level as an effective, low-cost, eco-friendly solution 
									for wastewater remediation.</p>

								<h3>Comparing Correlation between Color and Metallicity in Cluster vs Non-Cluster Galaxies</h3>
								<p>The purpose of this project, which I conducted in 9th grade, was to determine correlations between color and metallicity in both cluster and non-cluster galaxies 
									and compare them. The best-fit line equations for these correlations could then be used to calculate metallicity from a photometric g-r (color) reading.
									RA (right ascension) and DEC (declination) of member galaxies of the Virgo Cluster were retrieved from the ViZieR Database. Coordinates were converted 
									from sexagesimal to decimal degrees using Python. These coordinates were plugged into SDSS through a CasJobs SQL Query to retrieve g, r, H Alpha flux, 
									and Nii flux, as well as their errors. Color was expressed as g-r, and metallicity was calculated using a metallicity calibration formula from Pettini & 
									Pagel 2004. Data for non-cluster galaxies was retrieved with a radial search at RA and DEC of (0, 0). Both correlations show that g-r varies directly with metallicity.
